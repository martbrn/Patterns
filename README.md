# 🎯 Patterns in C#

A curated collection of **design patterns** implemented in **C#**.  
This repository demonstrates classic object-oriented design patterns with clean, practical examples and structured code.

## 📚 Contents

Organized by pattern type:

# 🏗️ Creational Patterns
- 🔁 **Singleton** – Ensures a class has only one instance.  
- 🏭 **Factory Method** – Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type.  
- 🧪 **Abstract Factory** – Provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
- 🧱 **Builder** – Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.  
- 🧬 **Prototype** – Creates new objects by copying an existing object.  

---

# 🧩 Structural Patterns
- 🔌 **Adapter** – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.  
- 🌉 **Bridge** – Decouples abstraction from implementation.  
- 🌲 **Composite** – Composes objects into tree structures.  
- 🎨 **Decorator** – Adds behavior to objects dynamically.  
- 🏠 **Facade** – Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.  
- 🪶 **Flyweight** – Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts.  
- 🕵️ **Proxy** – Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.  

---

# 🔁 Behavioral Patterns
- 🔗 **Chain of Responsibility** – Passes requests along a chain of handlers.  
- 🧾 **Command** – Encapsulates a request as an object.  
- 🧙 **Interpreter** – Defines a grammar and interpreter for a language.  
- 🔄 **Iterator** – Provides a way to access elements sequentially.  
- 🧭 **Mediator** – Defines an object that coordinates interaction between other objects.  
- 🗃️ **Memento** – Captures and restores an object's internal state.  
- 👀 **Observer** – Notifies dependent objects of changes.  
- ⚙️ **State** – Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
- 🧠 **Strategy** – Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.  
- 🧵 **Template Method** – Defines the program skeleton in a method.  
- 👨‍🏫 **Visitor** – Adds operations to classes without modifying them.
